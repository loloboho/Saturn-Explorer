## About This Project

This design represents an honest attempt at realistic spacecraft engineering for the outer solar system (2080). All feedback welcome.

This is my first application of AI. It has been a collaboration of AI celestial mechanics, delta-V, and CG calculations with my design in conceptual 3-D space using AutoCAD traditional three-view drafting.

I am responsible for the systems concepts; AI assisted with calculations and documentation. This AI was invaluable in its role, albeit being quite verbose. It is a very productive engineering tool; I see the implications for the future of AI.

## Influences

Charles Sheffield and Arthur C. Clarke have been an obvious influence. The Saturn Explorer looks a lot like the Discovery One in Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" for good reason. Arthur C. Clarke and Kubrick had it about right.

The Landers are similar to the Apollo Lunar Module because it works. The aesthetics of the ship are from functional design. The swept wings of the radiators shift the CG aft to maintain stability, not because they look cool.

## Design Philosophy

**"Proven over clever. Simple over complex. Maintainable over optimal."**

Every system was chosen for reliability and maintainability, not theoretical perfection. If I can't explain how to fix it in orbit, it doesn't belong on the ship.

## Favorite Design Elements

Some ideas I'm particularly proud of:

- **Wheels supporting the ring** - Mechanical, simple, maintainable bearing system
- **Aerobic digestion in the waste tanks** - Based on 10 years RV experience
- **Air scoops for ventilation** - No ductwork needed, forced circulation from ring rotation
- **Pallets for cargo** - Lighter and more flexible than containers

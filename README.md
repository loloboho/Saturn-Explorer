This is my first application of AI. It has been a collaboration of AI celestial mechanics and calculations with my design in conceptual 3-D space using AutoCAD traditional three view drafting. I am responsible for the systems concept, AI devloped the details. This AI was invalueable in its role albeit being quite verbose. It is a very productive engineering tool; I see the implications for the future of AI.
Charles Shefield and Arthur C. Clark have been an obvious influence. The Saturn-Explorer looks a lot like the Discovery One in Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" for good reason. Arthur C. Clark and Kubrick had it right.

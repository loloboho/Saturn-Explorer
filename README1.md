FUSION-POWERED DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION VESSEL

Diamond hard science fiction, 2080 technology

This is my first application of AI. It has been a collaboration of AI celestial mechanics, delta-V, and CG calculations with my design in conceptual 3-D space using AutoCAD traditional three view drafting. I am responsible for the systems concepts, AI devloped the details. This AI was invalueable in its role albeit being quite verbose. It is a very productive engineering tool; I see the implications for the future of AI.

Charles Shefield and Arthur C. Clark have been an obvious influence. The Saturn-Explorer looks a lot like the Discovery One in Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" for good reason. Arthur C. Clark and Kubrick had it about right. The Landers are similar to the Apollo Lunar Module because it works. The aesthetics of the ship are from functional design. The swept wings of the radiators shift the CG aft to maintain stability, not because they look cool.

Note: The wheels supporting the ring, aerobic digestion in the waste tanks, crew moving from rotating ring to non-rotating shelter from the ladder, air scoops for ventilation, pallets for cargo, these are some of my favorite ideas.

There are errors and rough spots in this project. I would be grateful for any corrections and ideas.
